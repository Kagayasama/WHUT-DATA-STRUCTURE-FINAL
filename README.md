# Q1 Josephus problem
People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.The problem — given the number of people, starting point i, direction, and number m to be skipped — is to choose the position x in the initial circle to avoid execution.Hint: using circular queue (linked)
Josephus ring (nice version) n people sitting around a round table. Starting with the person on i position counting off one by one, the person that counts m leave the table. The next person starts counting from 1 and the person counts m leave the table. Repeat this process until everyone leaves the table. The persons that left the table in order compose a new sequence. e.g. when n=8,m=4,i=1, new sequence is:                 4，8，5，2，1，3，7，6   
# Q2 Points
Write a program that will load the 100,000 points inside the unit square from the text file points. dat (available on the course web-page) and print the co-ordinates of the pair of points that are closest together. If possible, your program should complete the task in less than one second.
